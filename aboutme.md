## What's My Deal?
I'm an entrepreneurial Data and Analytics Engineering Leader with a +7 year track record of delivering robust data solutions that translate data into value for the business and its customers, currently working in Media and Entertainment. I specialize in building extensible, reliable and secure cloud data infrastructure, intuitive and performant models, and ML Initiatives while incorporating scalable SDLC best practices. I'm a product-oriented technical leader who fosters a culture of collaboration, innovation, and high impact.

## Where Have I Succeeded?

### Building Performant Data and Analytics Platforms
I brought FilmRise's data infrastructure from 0 to 1, spearheading the creation of its modern cloud data platform and team, enabling DataOps and ML capabilities, on budget and on time (Multi million dollar investment). This foundation unlocked advanced analytic capabilities and supported cross-functional data product development.
### Creating Valuable Data Products
At Initiative, I originated the analytics engineering function, creating extensible pipeline and warehousing solutions that availed new data sources like Google Analytics to analysts working across dozens of ad campaigns. At FilmRise, I redefined market intelligence capabilities, improving forecasting accuracy by ~130% and optimizing our BI tools to reduce ad-hoc data requests by over 50%. These improvements drove actionable insights for content acquisition and sales.
### Enhancing Productivity and Cohesion Across Teams
By implementing agile frameworks and breaking down data silos, I've reduced inefficiencies and empowered teams to collaborate across high-value workflows. For instance, integrating HubSpot CRM into a serverless data platform streamlined deal underwriting workflows, cutting lead time by over 100%.

## What Services Do I Offer?

- **Data Solutions Architecture:** I architect extensible and secure cloud platforms that eliminate operational headaches and support long-term growth.
- **Data and Analytics Engineering (IC, MNG):** My ETL and transformation implementations minimize data downtime and maximize quality and availability, from exploratory analytic tools to production grade predictive models that drive the bottom line.
- **Data Strategy:** I help you model your business and its data, guiding decisions about how to productize your data ecosystem iteratively and create business value along the way.
- **Team Building and Development:** I create org structures and developer frameworks that help data practitioners thrive in concert with business stakeholders, delivering high-quality work at scale without unnecessary "heroics".

## Why Work With Me?

- I've succeeded at every phase of the analytics development lifecycle, from architecting cloud infrastructure to presenting BI to executive stakeholders and every layer in between
- I'm almost always the most technical person in the data product and strategy discussion and the most business oriented and strategic person in the data engineering scrum
- I'm able to steer towards long term objectives and scale, but I also excel in the dirty work–employing tactical solutions and providing an onramp to further refinements
- I've consistently excelled as a player coach - getting special commendations for balancing an IC workload while managing upwards and cohering cross-functional talent

## What Have I Learned In Data Work?

1. All data projects need to fulfill real business needs and analytic demand. Without real org buy-in and bottom line purpose, analytics will, at best, be a sideshow.
2. Abundant data isn't inherently valuable—success lies in leveraging the right data in the right context at the right time.
3. Data and business modeling is not secondary—it should be done in the abstract before any solutions are planned or implemented.
4. Progress will happen along a maturity curve, fueled by a tight feedback loop of hypotheses testing and validation (or disproving) at each stage.
5. Disincentivize analyst "heroism". Build frameworks that prioritize modularity, extensibility, and automated data quality to avoid relying on "heroic" and negatively compounding interventions.
6. It should never take a data engineer more than 2 minutes to triage a pipeline error log in prod, nor an analytics consumer more than 5 minutes to extract a key datapoint.
