## Key Accomplishments

### Building Performant Data and Analytics Platforms
I brought [FilmRise's](https://filmrise.com/) **data infrastructure from 0 to 1**, spearheading the creation of its modern cloud data platform and team, **enabling DataOps and ML capabilities**, on budget and on time **(Multi million dollar investment)**. This foundation unlocked advanced analytic capabilities and supports rapid, cross-functional data product development.
### Creating Valuable Data Products
At [Initiative](https://initiative.com/), **I originated the analytics engineering function**, creating extensible pipeline and warehousing solutions that availed new data sources like Google Analytics to analysts working across dozens of integrated ad campaigns. **At FilmRise**, I built an expansive market intelligence model, **helped improve forecasting model accuracy by ~130%**, and optimized our BI tools to **reduce ad-hoc data requests by over 50%**.
### Enhancing Productivity and Cohesion Across Teams
By implementing agile frameworks and breaking down data silos, I've reduced inefficiencies and empowered teams to collaborate across high-value workflows. For instance, integrating finance's HubSpot CRM deal pipeline and the analytics platform streamlined deal underwriting workflows, delivering analyses and **cutting deal underwriting lead time by over 100%**.

- You can throw multi-faceted problems at me - I've delivered results at every phase of the analytics development lifecycle, from architecting cloud infrastructure to presenting BI to executive stakeholders.
- I'll be a dynamic collaborator as the most technical person in the strategy discussion and the most business oriented person in the data engineering scrum.
- I love helping teams steer towards long term objectives and scale, but I also excel in the dirty work–employing tactical solutions and providing an onramp to further refinements.

## Lessons I've Learned In Data Work

1. **Analytics with a Purpose:** All data projects need to fulfill real business needs and analytic demand. Without material org buy-in and bottom line purpose, analytics will, at best, be a sideshow.
2. **Data in a vacuum != Value:** Abundant data isn't inherently valuable—success lies in leveraging the right data in the right context at the right time.
3. **Model Your Data and Your Business:** Data and business modeling is not secondary—it should be done in the abstract before any solutions are planned or implemented.
4. **Progress is a Curve:** Progress will happen along a maturity curve, fueled by a tight feedback loop of hypotheses testing and validation (or disproof) at each stage.
5. **Down with Analyst "Heroics":** Disincentivize analyst "heroism" aka spaghetti workflows. Build frameworks that prioritize modularity, extensibility, and automated data quality to avoid relying on "heroic" and negatively compounding interventions.
6. **Tool Friction Adds Up:** It should never take a data engineer more than 2 minutes to track and triage a pipeline bug in prod, nor an analytics consumer more than 5 minutes to extract a key datapoint.
