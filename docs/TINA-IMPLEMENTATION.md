### Log Entry (2025-05-05):
- **TinaCMS + S3 media uploads are now working locally.**
  - Can create and update galleries via TinaCMS admin, including uploading images directly to S3.
  - Both flat markdown files and folder-based galleries render correctly as long as they use `layout: photo_gallery`.
  - Manual step: To appear in the main gallery listing, new galleries must be added to `_data/photo_collections.yml`.
  - CORS policy and S3 credentials are set for local development; production setup is next.

### Next Steps (Priority Order):
1. ~~**Test Gallery Content Management**~~ ✓
   - ~~Create test galleries with manual S3 URLs~~ ✓
   - ~~Verify S3 URL validation works~~ ✓
   - ~~Test gallery rendering in Jekyll~~ ✓

2. **Complete Content Types**
   - Implement Services page schema
   - Implement About page schema
   - Test content creation and rendering

3. **Documentation & Deployment**
   - Document production deployment process
   - Set up CI/CD workflow for TinaCMS + Jekyll
   - Add deployment notes for environment variables

## Notes
- TinaCMS local development and content management is fully functional
- Blog post creation, editing, and display systems are working well
- Gallery system integration with TinaCMS is progressing:
  - S3 image hosting is working for existing galleries
  - Direct S3 uploads from TinaCMS admin are now functional
  - Gallery creation and management via TinaCMS is implemented
